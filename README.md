# Asp.net Core Webapi

The single purpose of this API is to provide test enpoints which are secured by various kinds of claims. To access most endpoints an access token must be provided. To retrieve such a token, you must use an authentication server. It should work out of the box if <a href="https://github.com/latsic/idServer">this authentication server</a> is used.

There is also an <a href="https://github.com/latsic/vue_oidc_client">SPA</a> which uses this webapi and the mentioned authentication server.

## Built With

* [AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/) - The web framework used
* [Identity Server 4](https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4) - OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 Framework
